        <p>The idea of nanotechnology has been started since 1980 and it is developed by many scientists from years to years because it is believed can be used in everything in our daily lives to enhance the our lifestyle. There are some examples of the best nanoparticles products. For instances, clay nanoparticles allow Miller Brewing to bottle its beer in plastic containers. The tiny reinforcements keep oxygen out and hold carbon dioxide in, which prevents the brewed beverage from spoiling. Gold nanoparticles make genetic tests more user-friendly and even make pregnancy tests easier to read. Besides, Aluminosilicate Nanoparticles stop bleeding in a hurry. With this existing concept and a technology tool from Google called Google Glass, we have come out with some different new ideas that nanotechnology can be applied in contact lens to help us in most of our daily activities.</p>
