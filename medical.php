        <h2>Nanotechnology in medical field</h2>

        <p>Nanotechnology that is embedded in Smart Contact Lens can help to measure the blood sugar level in our body. Replace the visible electrode with transparent, highly stretchable nanowires.</p>
        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="ospic/design.jpg" alt="Lens"></p>        
        <p>Nanowires are able to self-monitor blood glucose levels and eye pressure by exposing to the tears. Users can choose to display the details through AR or sending to other devices. Through the embedded wireless antenna in the contact lens sensor, users can transmit their health information to their smartphones</p>

        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="ospic/usingapp.jpg" alt="User using app"></p>
        <p>For those which cannot be tested using tears, a sensor which is made by nanoparticles is designed to be started working when it is alerted.</p>
        <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="ospic/blood.jpg" alt="Nanoparticles" width=500px></p>
        <p>The nanosized sensor will be sent and diffuse into your bloodstream to check since it is tiny enough to squeeze through every cell. The nanoparticle will scan and check oneâ€™s heath while following the flow of the oxygenated blood through the whole body return to the lens while it has finished scanned the whole body. The details will be displayed through AR or sent to any devices you want.</p>
